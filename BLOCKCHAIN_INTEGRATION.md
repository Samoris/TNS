# TNS Blockchain Integration Status

## Current Implementation (Simulated)

The TNS system currently uses **simulated blockchain integration** for demonstration purposes:

- **Transaction Handling**: Uses placeholder contract address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`
- **NFT Minting**: No actual NFT is minted - the system only tracks ownership in memory storage
- **Network**: Connected to Intuition testnet but contracts are not deployed
- **Data Storage**: Domain ownership stored in local memory, not on-chain

## Why No NFT Was Minted

When you registered `samhoeris.trust`, the transaction was sent but:
1. The contract address is a placeholder (not a real deployed contract)
2. No smart contract exists to mint the ERC-721 NFT
3. The backend only updates local storage, not blockchain state

## To Enable Real NFT Minting

### 1. Deploy Smart Contracts
Deploy the TNS contracts to Intuition testnet:
- `TNSRegistry.sol` (ERC-721 for domain NFTs)
- `TNSResolver.sol` (for address resolution)

### 2. Update Contract Addresses
Replace placeholder addresses in the frontend with actual deployed contract addresses:

```typescript
// In client/src/lib/web3.ts or config
const TNS_REGISTRY_ADDRESS = "0x..." // Real deployed contract address
const TNS_RESOLVER_ADDRESS = "0x..." // Real deployed contract address
```

### 3. Update Transaction Calls
Modify the registration transaction to call actual smart contract functions:

```typescript
// Instead of sending encoded data
const registrationTx = await sendTransaction(
  TNS_REGISTRY_ADDRESS,
  totalCost,
  contractInterface.encodeFunctionData("register", [domainName, duration])
);
```

### 4. Add Contract ABI Integration
Include the contract ABI to properly encode function calls and decode events.

## Current Benefits of Simulation

- **Full UI/UX Testing**: Complete registration flow works
- **Network Integration**: MetaMask connection and network switching functional  
- **Domain Management**: Search, registration, and management features complete
- **Pricing Logic**: Tiered pricing system implemented and working

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Deploy Contracts**: Use the provided `TNSRegistry.sol` contract
2. **Update Frontend**: Replace placeholder addresses with real contract addresses
3. **Add Contract ABI**: Include proper contract interface for function calls
4. **Test NFT Minting**: Verify NFTs appear in wallet after registration
5. **Add Event Listening**: Listen for contract events to confirm successful registration

The current system provides a complete foundation - you just need to deploy the smart contracts and update the addresses to enable real NFT minting.
